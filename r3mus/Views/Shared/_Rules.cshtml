<ul>
    <li>Be helpful and supportive to your corp, alliance and coalition friends.</li>
    <li>While playing the game, be on corp Teamspeak & alliance voice comms at all times. If you don't wish to participate in a conversation, we have designated "quiet" rooms, but we still require members to be connected.</li>
    <li>Participate in PvP fleets whenever you can.</li>
    <li>Complete the basic training and join us in our staging systems within two weeks of joining.</li>
    <li>Follow the skill plans we provide which will enable you to fly all our corp doctrine ships within a reasonable timeframe.</li>
    <li>Don't smack-talk in in-game local chat. Keep it classy because you represent our corp and alliance.</li>
    <li>Do not behave in a discriminatory or prejudiced manner. Racist, sexist, homophobic or any other bigoted opinions are not welcome, and are grounds for removal from corp.</li>
    <li>Keep yourself up to date with news by reading in-game bulletin boards, in-game mails and our Slack #news channel.</li>
    <li>Do not participate in highsec ganking unless specifically permitted to do so by a Fleet Commander or Director/CEO from our corp.</li>
    <li>Ensure that your assets in our staging system(s) are kept to a minimum at all times. Be in the habit of keeping the proceeds of PvE separately to your ships and fittings, and have non-required items transported to highsec on a weekly basis.</li>
